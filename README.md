# Instructions

There are three branches in this project: `exerciseOne`, `exerciseTwo` and `exerciseThree`. You should switch to them by using `git checkout [branch name]`.

If you have modified the original version and you want to switch of branches again, you must commit your changes. Otherwise, you will not be allowed to travel between branches.

***

### Exercise One

Try to access to the title element by using the DOM methods.
You can try to get it by using its tag name, its class name or its id.
Then, try to get its text content only.

### Exercise Two

Here you are going to try changing the color of the title's text to any other of your preference.

### Exercise Three

We are going to modify the article's content by adding whatever you want instead of the red square.

Challenge: try adding new red squares to the article. How would you do it ?
Don't worry about the styles, they are already done for you. You should only worry about how to create them by using the DOM methods.

Have fun and don't be afraid of breaking up everything !
Happy coding !
