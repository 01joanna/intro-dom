# Instructions

There are three branches in this project: `exerciseOne`, `exerciseTwo` and `exerciseThree`. You should switch to them by using `git checkout [branch name]`.

If you have modified the original version and you want to switch of branches again, you must commit your changes. Otherwise, you will not be allowed to travel between branches.

***

### Exercise One

Try to access to access to the `header` element by using the DOM methods.
You can try to get it by using its tag name, its class name and its id.
Then, try to get its text content only.

### Exercise Two

Here you are going to try changing the color of the title's text to any other of your preference.

### Exercise Three

We are going to add red squares by crating new HTML elements. Don't worry about the styles, they are already done for you. You should only worry about how to create them by using the DOM methods.

Have fun and don't be afraid of breaking up everything !
Happy coding !
